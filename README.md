# Breastfeeding in Wales Research

This study will look into the factors that influence a woman's decision to breastfeed her child, such as demographics and well-being factors like stress, as well as the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Welsh Government is particularly interested in determining the role of time constraints and the availability of support in the early discontinuation of breastfeeding.

To answer these questions, I employed a variety of statistical techniques, including regression analysis, a data-driven approach that takes into account all potential factors, and survival analysis to determine how long mothers breastfeed and whether this is affected by workload and domestic support. The purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of the difficulties that new mothers face, as well as to identify strategies to support breastfeeding in the context of modern life and the pandemic.

## Processing and Analysis [Script]

This analysis (script) is a standard statistical analysis that employs regression and a data-driven approach to ensure that all potential factors are accounted for in the model.

## Survival Analysis [Script]

This script investigates how long mothers breastfeed and whether workload and domestic support influence this.
