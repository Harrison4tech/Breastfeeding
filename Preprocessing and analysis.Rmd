### Objective

Data was collected from pregnant women in order to investigate the factors that may influence women's intentions to breastfeed, ranging from demographic characteristics to well-being factors such as stress, as well as the impact of Covid.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(visdat)
library(dplyr)

breastfeed <- read.csv("~/Documents/PMIM202J/Assignment data/Born in Wales Data June 2022 2/Born in Wales Data June 2022.csv")

head(breastfeed) # preview data

# Rename columns
colnames(breastfeed) <- c('ID', 'start_time', 'delivery_date', 'language', 'ethnicity', 'nationality', 'relationship', 'sexuality', 'covid_symp', 'symp_start', 'symp_type', 'covid_treat', 'test', 'low_mood', 'interest', 'depression', 'sleep_stat', 'tiredness', 'eating', 'down_feeling', 'trouble', 'movement', 'suicidal', 'smoke', 'alcohol_intake', 'anxiety', 'worry_ctrl', 'worry_too_much', 'trouble_relaxing', 'restlessness', 'annoyed_irritable', 'scared', 'pa_freq', 'pa', 'cycling', 'walking', 'home_childcare', 'gardening', 'walk_pace', 'weight', 'height', 'preg_stress', 'rel_issues', 'legal_financial_issues', 'victim_of_crime', 'serious_illness', 'death', 'covid_related_stress', 'emotion_financial_support', 'stress_range', 'healthcare_range', 'covid_preg_change', 'maternity_care', 'midwife_support', 'baby_feed', 'other_children', 'no_children', 'child_age_gap', 'occupation', 'education', 'work', 'work_basis', 'no_occupants', 'income', 'talk_to_outsiders', 'contact_with_outsiders', 'answers_count', 'wimd_2019_rank', 'wimd_2019_decile', 'wimd_2019_quintile', 'wimd_2019_quantile', 'covid_vaccine_during_preg', 'submit')

# duplicate data for future use
duplicate_data <- breastfeed

head(breastfeed) # preview renamed columns

# notice there are empty values, change these empty values to 'NA' so they can be easy to analyse
breastfeed <- breastfeed %>% mutate_all(na_if, "")

# check for na
colSums(is.na(breastfeed))

# To be able to determine columns to retain and analyse, we would need to know the features that contributes mostly to the NAs distribution. A rule of thumb is to remove features with more than 20% missing data but I would use my discretion based on the objective of this project

# Check percentage of overall missing data
paste("Percentage of missing data is:", sum(is.na(breastfeed))/prod(dim(breastfeed)) * 100,"percent")

# It can be seen that we have approximately 32% missing data, now let's see which feature contributes more.
library(VIM)
aggr_plot <- aggr(breastfeed, col=c('purple', 'red'), numbers=TRUE, sortVars=TRUE, labels=names(breastfeed),
                  cex.axis=.7, gap=3, ylab=c("Histogram of Missing Values", "Pattern"))

# Looking at the output to the code above, it is obvious that some features have NAs above 20%. We have just less than 35 features with missing data below 20%. One of the objective of this project is to investigate the factors that might impact womenâ€™s choice of infant feeding from demographic features  and other factors such as stress as well as the impact of Covid. Looking at the percent distribution of NAs, covid related collated information contributes more to this rota. Therefore we would remove the first and last variable as they would not be needed and further remove features that have above 20% missing values.

# As regards the series of question relating to covid19 namely:
# covid symptom
# symptom start 
# symptom type
# covid treatment
# if tested

# Deeper missing values analysis
library(dlookr)
library(flextable)

# visualise missing values
plot_na_pareto(breastfeed)
plot_na_intersect(breastfeed)

diagnose(breastfeed) %>% flextable() # another cool way to look at the missing values and the rate of uniqueness

# Remove variables that are unimportant to this analysis and variables with missing data above 20%

breastfeed <- subset(breastfeed, select= -c(ID, start_time, delivery_date, wimd_2019_rank, wimd_2019_decile, wimd_2019_decile, wimd_2019_quintile, wimd_2019_quantile, submit, rel_issues, victim_of_crime, death, no_children, child_age_gap, answers_count, covid_symp, symp_start, symp_type, covid_treat, test, legal_financial_issues, covid_vaccine_during_preg, talk_to_outsiders, depression, movement, serious_illness, eating, suicidal, down_feeling, stress_range, sleep_stat, interest, contact_with_outsiders, tiredness, trouble, covid_preg_change, no_occupants, work_basis, sexuality, trouble_relaxing, gardening, cycling, restlessness, scared, midwife_support, occupation))

# remove missing observations

- Output shows features and their percentage of missing observations.

### Demographics
```{r}
# Table 1
# To create a demographic table, let's create an object with demographical features
demographics <- c("language", "ethnicity", "nationality", "relationship", "education", "work", "income")

# assign our response variable to an object
dependent <- c("baby_feed")

#install.packages("tableone")
require(tableone) # need to visualise a table
table1 <- CreateTableOne(demographics, breastfeed, strata = c("baby_feed"))
print(table1, quote=F, noSpaces = T)
```

- Demographics table



### Logistic Regression
This model is designed to handle binary and categorical variables. Since our data contains mostly categorical variables, we would run a logistic regression model to find out the relationship between our response variable (baby_feed) and explanatory variables (relationship, education, income, work, support, maternity care)

```{r}
# recode our response variable to binary form 
breastfeed <- breastfeed %>% mutate(baby_feed=ifelse(baby_feed == "Breast milk only", 0, 1)) 
breastfeed$baby_feed <- as.factor(breastfeed$baby_feed) # turn response variable to factor 

# Total number of respondents by the planned method of breastfeeding
feed_table <- table(breastfeed$baby_feed)
rownames(feed_table) <- c("Breast milk only=0", "Alternatives=1")
feed_table
```

```{r}
# fit logistic Regression model
# Includes all features from previous studies
model1 <- glm(baby_feed~relationship + education + income + maternity_care + work + emotion_financial_support, data = breastfeed, family = "binomial")
summary(model1)
```


### Odds Ratio and confidence interval
```{r}
# view the odds ration of our log model
exp(model1$coefficients[-1])

# view confidence interval of the model
exp(confint(model1))
```

```{r}
# plot the variable of importance
require(caret)
plot_imp <- varImp(model6, scale = FALSE)

```

### Covid impact on intention to breastfeed
```{r}

# covid19 related pregnancy stress
covid_model <- glm(baby_feed~covid_related_stress, data=breastfeed, family = "binomial")
summary(covid_model)

# view just the odds ratio of our model done on covid above
(exp(covid_model$coefficients[-1])-1)*100

```


```{r}

# Look at what determines breastfeeding
# With the use of decision trees method. Since our data has been pre-proceed to fit this algorithm, we would just split the data into train and test partition. The train dataset would be used to train the algorithm to perform its classification and then use the model to predict features that would be classified.

require(caret) 
set.seed(123) # set seed for reproducability

# split data 
feed_train <- createDataPartition(breastfeed$baby_feed, p=0.75, list = FALSE)

train = breastfeed[feed_train,] # 75% train data drawn from original data
test = breastfeed[-feed_train,] # 25% test data

view(train) # view partitioned train data
view(test) # view partitioned test data

# check and confirm sizes of newly partitioned data
paste(cat(
    "Original Data is:", nrow(breastfeed), "samples\n",
    "Training set is:", nrow(train), "samples\n",
    "Test set is:", nrow(test), "samples"
))

```


### Classifier Training
Using Random Forest Model, a machine learning model tofind out features that determine the choice to breastfeed.

### Random Forest Model

```{r}
require(randomForest)

# Train the model
randfor <- randomForest(baby_feed~., data = train)
print(randfor)
```

- 
```{r}
# view result
summary(randfor)
plot(randfor) # visualise the trained model

# tune the trained model to increase accuracy by finding out the optimal ntree and mtry 
#name of features to omit dependent variable
features <- setdiff(names(train), "baby_feed")

mtry <- tuneRF(train[features], train$baby_feed, ntreeTry = 500,
               stepFactor = 1.5, improve = 0.01, trace = TRUE, plot = TRUE)

print(mtry)

# create an object to determine the optimal number of mtry to be used during tuning
best.mtry <- mtry[mtry[, 2] == min(mtry[, 2]), 1]
print(best.mtry)

```


-
```{r}

# find variables of importance from the trained model
importance(randfor)
varUsed(randfor) # look at variables used and its distribution

# Top 15 variables of importance
varImpPlot(randfor, sort = T, n.var = 15, main = "Top 15 - Variable Importance")
```
The output shows the first 15 variables of importance. From here a hypothesis would be developed and findings presented. From this output, education, weight, height, income, health care satisfaction have occurred many times.

```{r}
# predict using test data
pred_rf <- predict(randfor, newdata = test)
summary(pred_rf)

table(pred_rf, test$baby_feed)

# confusion matrix to view the error rate and distribution predicted vs actual
conf_mat <- confusionMatrix(pred_rf, as.factor(test$baby_feed))
conf_mat

# display predicted vs actual
results<-cbind(pred_rf,test$baby_feed) # create the result object

colnames(results)<-c('pred','actual') # name the columns
results<-as.data.frame(results) # set the result to a data frame
View(results)

# Accuracy of the model
# This lets us know how good our model is in prediction
paste("The model accuracy is:", sum(pred_rf==test$baby_feed) / nrow(test) * 100, "percent")

```

### ROC 
Prediction and Performance Metric
```{r}
# ROC
require(ROCR)
pred_data = predict(randfor, type="prob", newdata = test)
forest_pred = prediction(pred_data[,2], test$baby_feed)

# Area under curve
auc = performance(forest_pred, measure = "auc")

# True positive and true negative
forest_perf = performance(forest_pred, "tpr", "fpr")

# PLot ROC Curve
plot(forest_perf, main="ROC Curve (Random Forest)", col=2, lwd=2)
abline(0, 1, lwd=2, lty = 2, col="gray")
